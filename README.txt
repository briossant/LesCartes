LosCartos is a guessing game where you need to select the right card in order to get your score to increase.
Starting at level 1, there will only be one card for you to click on. At level two there will be two cards, and so on for every other level.
Be careful tho because only one card in each round will be the right one. To allow you to have a good time while testing your luck,
"El sonidito", a well-known mexican music, will greatly help you.
